# NBV-Net:  A 3D Convolutional Neural Network for Predicting the Next-Best-View

This is a pytorch implementation of the network proposed by Mendoza for next best view planning.

The next best view is the sensor pose that increases the reconstructed surface of an object.

This implementation uses the NBV-dataset.

Some examples of the dataset are:
