# NBV-Net:  A 3D Convolutional Neural Network for Predicting the Next-Best-View

This repository is a modified and cleaned version of the original code for Next Best View network proposed by Mendoza in the following preprint:
> Mendoza, M., Vasquez-Gomez, J. I., Taud, H., Sucar, L. E., & Reta, C. (2019). Supervised Learning of the Next-Best-View for 3D Object Reconstruction. arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.05833.

The modifications are authored by Alexey I. Boyko and Dmitry Smirnov as a part of Foundations of DS class at Skoltech.
